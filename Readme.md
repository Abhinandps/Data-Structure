What is an Algorithm 

* An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

* Time Complexity: Time taken by the algorithm to solve the problem. It is measured by calculating the iteration of loops, number of comparisons etc.
Time complexity is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.
“Time” can mean the number of memory accesses performed, the number of comparisons between integers, the number of times some inner loop is executed, or some other natural unit related to the amount of real time the algorithm will take.


* Space Complexity: Space taken by the algorithm to solve the problem. It includes space used by necessary input variables and any extra space (excluding the space taken by inputs) that is used by the algorithm. For example, if we use a hash table (a kind of data structure), we need an array to store values so 



# Asymptotic Notation and Analysis (Based on input size) in Complexity Analysis of Algorithms

* Asymptotic notation is a way to describe the running time or space complexity of an algorithm based on the input size. It is commonly used in complexity analysis to describe how an algorithm performs as the size of the input grows. The three most commonly used notations are Big O, Omega, and Theta.

1. Big O notation (O):
2. Big Theta notation (Θ):
3. Big omega notation(ω):

What is Data Structure:

* A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
* A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

* Linear data structure: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

* Non-linear data structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only.
