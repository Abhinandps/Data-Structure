# What is an Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
- Time taken by the algorithm to solve the problem.
- Measured by calculating iterations, comparisons, etc.
- Describes the algorithm's time requirements based on input size.

**Space Complexity:**
- Space taken by the algorithm, including necessary input variables and extra space.

## Asymptotic Notation and Analysis

Asymptotic notation describes an algorithm's performance based on input size:
- **Big O notation (O):**
- **Big Theta notation (Θ):**
- **Big Omega notation (ω):**

# What is Data Structure

A data structure is a storage used to store and organize data efficiently.

## Linear Data Structure

Data elements arranged sequentially with each element attached to its previous and next adjacent elements.

## Non-linear Data Structure

Data elements not placed sequentially; traversal requires multiple runs.
